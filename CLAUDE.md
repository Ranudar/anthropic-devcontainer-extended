# Project Notes

## Future Evaluation

- **Mount strategy**: Currently mounts `~/.claude` from Mac host, causing path translation issues (fixed in `setup-plugins.sh`). Consider:
  1. Remove mount entirely → self-contained, but slower (re-downloads plugins)
  2. Mount only credentials subdirectory → middle ground
  3. Keep current approach with path fixes → current solution

## Flow-Next

This project uses Flow-Next for task tracking. Use `.flow/bin/flowctl` instead of markdown TODOs or TodoWrite.

**Quick commands:**
```bash
.flow/bin/flowctl list                # List all epics + tasks
.flow/bin/flowctl epics               # List all epics
.flow/bin/flowctl tasks --epic fn-N   # List tasks for epic
.flow/bin/flowctl ready --epic fn-N   # What's ready
.flow/bin/flowctl show fn-N.M         # View task
.flow/bin/flowctl start fn-N.M        # Claim task
.flow/bin/flowctl done fn-N.M --summary-file s.md --evidence-json e.json
```

**Rules:**
- Use `.flow/bin/flowctl` for ALL task tracking
- Do NOT create markdown TODOs or use TodoWrite
- Re-anchor (re-read spec + status) before every task

**More info:** `.flow/bin/flowctl --help` or read `.flow/usage.md`
